The number of steps ($N$), the angular frequency $\\omega_0$, and the initial conditions $x_0$ and $v_0$ can be adjusted. The graph displays the numerical solution (red points) and the exact solution (dashed blue line). It is obvious that the basic Euler method diverges from the exact solution very quickly, wheras the Euler-Cromer method provides a good approximation even for small step numbers.\n",
